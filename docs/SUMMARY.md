## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why No Framework?
- Vanilla JS is sufficient for this use case
- No framework overhead or updates needed
- Faster load times
- Easier for others to understand

### Why No Build Process?
- Anyone can edit the files directly
- No npm, webpack, or compilation needed
- Works anywhere without setup
- Easy to debug in browser

### Why No TypeScript?
- JavaScript is sufficient for this project
- Works in all browsers without compilation
- Lower barrier to contribution
- Simpler for end users
